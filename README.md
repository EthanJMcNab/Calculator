# Calculator
A functional calculator in HTML using html, css and javascript.

I only utilised Javascript when implementing the calculator, as I wanted to improve on my DOM manipulation skills.

Currently, you can only do simple equations with one operator and whole numbers. In the future, I will implement the decimal.
